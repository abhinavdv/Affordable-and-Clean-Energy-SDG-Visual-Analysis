# Affordable-and-Clean-Energy-SDG-Visual-Analysis
**Conclusions/Observations through analysis: **
1. The world has started making significant strides towards achieving the goal of affordable and clean energy outlined in the SDGs. 
2. This is particularly true from 2018 though some regions started ahead in time. The global share of renewable energy in the power mix has increased from 16.7% consumption in 2010 to 19.77% in 2020. 
3. In addition, the percentage of people with access to electricity has increased by nearly 12%
since 2010. 
4. That said, significant efforts must be put in to achieve this goal by 2030. Further, inferring from Fig8, all the regions have changed course and are moving towards more accessible and renewable energy which will likely yield a quicker growth in the coming years.
5. Some other notable conclusions drawn in other parts of this analysis include the rural-urban gap in access to electricity and the necessity to put in more efforts in Sub-Saharan Africa region to increase access to electricity.
6. I also explored how India’s quick progress in electrification was the key for South Asia’s rapid increase in percentage of people with access to electricity.
